                <h1>What Got Me Into Software Engineering?</h1>
                <p>I was in college for health and fittness science for one semester before I started having second thoughts. I have always been very interested in computers and why things worked the way they did, so I looked into it and started coding. I fell in love, and  at the point I wanted to take my skills to the next step. So I enrolled in a coding bootcamp, General Assembly.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>I studied at the coding bootcamp General Assembly. I took the 6-month Software Engineering Immersive course for full-stack development. This course used GitHub for every homework assignment and project we submitted. We did a lot of pair programming, group projects and also solo projects.</p>
